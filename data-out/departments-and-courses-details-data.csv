Studio offerings range in their nature, but will all encompass working on a project through all aspects of design, from research and conceptual formation, to a detailed level of resolution and technical refinement. Master of Architecture studios help students to act in the world in a conscientious manner, to work with others, and to communicate (through verbal and visual means) with clarity and maturity.
Architecture Studio 9 involves framing a research question and testing numerous possibilities for its projectual conceptualisation. Research should entail the assembly of work by students themselves, as well as relevant work by others, and must be developed through design processes: making, critiquing and evolving an architectural scheme.Architecture Studio 10
Design-led research praxis: Master of Architecture Studios are designed to inhabit the rich territory between the theoretical, the propositional and the situational. Individual Studio briefs may range in scope and nature, they all attend to this nexus, while questioning normative assumptions about design and environments. Design-led research praxis is defined as the explorative embodiment of concepts through rigorous, critical, project-based design exploration, informed by gathering, analysing, and synthesising an array of relevant information.
Complex projects and contexts: Architecture’s critical relationship to the complex nature of built and unbuilt environments is key. Studios focus on architecture’s affects: on contributions to, and integration into, complex, extant environments – be they physical, social, cultural, or ecological. Students will navigate complexities and constraints in a variety of forms.
Synthesis and testing: All studios will incorporate methodologies of analogue and/or digital analysis and testing to frame, progress, and refine propositions. Students will experiment with design methods, media, and representational strategies. Formal, compositional, and aesthetic choices should be underpinned by explorative design processes.
Resolution and refinement: Master of Architecture studio projects require a capacity for producing coherent architectural proposals, incorporating structural, technical, technological and performative building requirements. Students will develop a capacity for critical and creative reflection on their own work and others’ as part of this refinement.
Ethics and inclusivity: Master of Architecture projects entail an ethical dimension and acknowledge their presence on unceded lands whether local or global. Resilience and custodianship for human and non-human agents underpin studio projects, and considerations for difference, diversity and respect are cultivated as paramount to the actions of an architect
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Critically reflect on a brief or project framework toward the refinement of a design research strategy.
2. Demonstrate a capacity for self-direction and critical reflection through verbal and textual means.

Plants are multicellular, sessile organisms composed of many different cell types originated from restricted regions of plant tissues called meristems. The coordinated development of different plant cell types requires cell division, expansion and differentiation and their organisation into specific tissues and organs to produce a functional plant. Much of this highly ordered cell development is driven by gene expression in response to the surrounding environment.

In contrast to the past 12,000 years of the Holocene’s relative stability, the Anthropocene refers to the profound and accelerating human transformations of the earth’s climate and environment. However, while it is necessary to acknowledge the accelerating global impact of humanity on our world, we also must recognise that such changes are not universal. Rather the Anthropocene produces and reproduces unequal geographies of political, social, cultural and economic relations. This course takes up the challenge proposed by philosophers, social scientists and scientists who argue that nothing less than a transformation of society is needed to move us towards a sustainable future. To respond to this challenge, students will critically examine conceptual, ethical and practical tools for rethinking and determining measures of sustainability. Insights from complexity theory, contemporary social thought, and non-western knowledges that can provide ways of reimagining cities, agriculture, everyday life, consumption and waste will provide opportunities for students to examine and evaluate current and proposed pathways and processes of transformation towards sustainability.
Previous course title - Sustainability: Theory and PracticeEnvironmental Remediation

""Modern biology has produced a genuinely new way of looking at the world...to the degree that [when] we come to understand other organisms, we will place greater value on them, and on ourselves."" (E.O. Wilson, 1984). Our concerns about the conservation of biodiversity are intrinsically related to the conservation of genetic diversity and the natural evolutionary system that shapes this diversity. Conservation biology focuses on understanding the biology of endangerment and the processes that influence this, while conservation science and management consider the regulatory environment and habitat management tools for mitigating such impacts.
This course explores the principles of nature conservation and the paradigm of global biodiversity against the backdrop of the processes affecting them in the Anthropocene, such as climate change, global mobility and habitat degradation. Major patterns of biodiversity change and decline are investigated using case studies from around the world including the spread of wildlife disease, removal of apex predators and community knock-on effects and species loss due to habitat degradation. A major component of the course is a critique of the range of policy and practice initiatives designed to ameliorate anthropogenic impacts to biodiversity, including analysis of the statutory environment for impact assessment and consent conditions in developed and developing countries as well as recent advances in scientific and management methods including habitat manipulations and reintroductions.Advanced Research Project

Globalisation is a complex phenomenon, with contested meanings.  Broadly, globalisation refers to linkages or integration across nations, in labour and capital markets, in trade, communications, and technology. A major driver of, and mechanism for, globalisation is business, through trans-border production and consumption of goods and services.  There are also other active stakeholders in globalisation, including governments, regional or international inter-governmental organisations focused on specific interests (e.g. economics, trade, and labour standards), local communities, non-government organisations (NGOs), and unions. The intersecting forces of globalisation can have positive, negative, and, sometimes, entirely unexpected consequences. While globalisation has the potential to deliver general benefits, the specific interests of these stakeholders can - and do - come into conflict with the interests of business.  Because of this, it is critical for managers to understand the context, the stakeholders, the institutions, and the relevant rules and regulations that influence managerial activities in the global environment.International Accounting

Effective accounting Is not simply about the processes of keeping financial records of business transactions.  Accounting practices can also create significant value for a business by ensuring that management decisions are well-informed, and properly directed towards achieving the goals of the business.  Accounting practices are improving with use of new technology, which increases the speed as well as the amount of information available. Accounting processes and information must also meet appropriate professional and international standards for disclosure to shareholders and other stakeholders.  Business cycles are shortening but also, with the increase in cross-national business structures and organisations that come with globalisation, becoming increasingly complex.

Patterns of social, economic and cultural diversity and difference are examined from the perspective of national, international and local situations. Core components include Geographies of globalisation (including geographies of population, migration, economies, landscapes, resources and environments and Indigenous geographies) and Globalisation and urban and regional development (cities and rural spaces).
 
 
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Apply key geographical concepts relating to the functioning and interaction of population, society, settlement and the development of resources.
2. Demonstrate understanding of processes affecting places and their populations at a range of scales: global, national and local by identifying, describing and analysing geographic phenomena.
3. Employ basic geographical skills to construct and interpret maps, graphs, and tables based on data collected from primary and secondary sources in class-based and field-based exercises.
4. Communicate key geographical concepts in a range of forms, including critical summaries and reports.
Human Geography is a diverse discipline that explains the relationships between people and places in the world we live in. In this course students develop an understanding and appreciation of the interactions between people and places through the core themes of globalisation, development, urbanisation, diversity and inequality. The course explores the ways in which global and local forces continuously shape socio-cultural and economic landscapes including cities and countrysides. Case studies are drawn from a mix of Australian and international examples. An important component of the course is the development of student skills and competencies in three major areas: the use and misuse of indicators of socio-cultural and economic change; techniques for field-based analysis of controversial local issues; and the distillation and communication of key arguments from relevant academic materials. Skills and concepts developed in the course are highly useful in other subject areas and for future employment opportunities.Global Poverty and Development

Climate change is today one of the top agendas in both domestic and international politics. The broad range of actors and systems that it impacts, such as humans and life, the earth, the oceans, the atmosphere and all in between, has prompted an unprecedented attention on the issue. There is also an acute focus on the great concern it poses for human rights protection. However, though the science of climate change has been established for a while now, the political, economic and social context within which we deal with climate change has meant that responses are slow. The existence of a wide array of actors and interests represented in the climate change debate continues to affect mitigation and adaptation strategies. This hurdle relates both to dealing with climate change and its impacts. A recognition of the direct impact of climate change on current and future generations and the urgency with which the international community needs to act has therefore given rise to an advocacy strategy that puts human rights at the centre of policy debates.
This course will focus on issues at the intersection of climate change and human rights as they relate to a particular impact of climate change: the forced displacement of people from their abodes. It explores the institutions and actors as well as the international legal frameworks on climate change, human rights and forcibly displaced persons. Students will gain specialised knowledge of the impacts of climate change and the debate arounds approaches to dealing with them. The course further involves case studies that highlight the themes and considers special issues related to climate change.

The topics in this course include the following:
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Critically reflect on different theoretical perspectives regarding the influence of business entities on respect for human rights and the environment and be prepared to comment on these perspectives.
2. Compare and critically evaluate efforts by states to ensure that business entities respect human rights and the environment through judicial and state-based non-judicial mechanisms and by providing scope for alternative legal structures, such as cooperatives.

4. Design appropriate and innovative strategies to influence corporations to move towards the organisational change required to address human rights abuse or environmental degradation that is linked to their business activity.
Traditionally, states have primarily sought to ensure that business entities operate in a socially and environmentally responsible manner by using a 'command and control' approach: that is, they have established legal rules and put in place inspectorates and courts to monitor compliance and punish non-compliance. 
Globalisation has challenged this approach, and even for business activity wholly within state borders this model has not always proved effective. This course will critically consider the efficacy of legal and non-judicial alternatives, including: alternative legal structures for business (especially cooperatives), responsive regulation, multi-stakeholder initiatives, ethical investment and ethical consumerism. Case examples will focus on state and private initiatives designed to ensure that business entities respect employment rights and operate in an environmentally responsible manner.Conciliation

4. Demonstrate their own capabilities and behaviours to become effective and ethical participants in, and leaders of, innovation in organisations
5. Work independently and collaboratively on assessments while reflecting on individual and group behaviours relating to innovative activity
Innovation does not happen without people. Within and outside organisations, individuals are critical agents who can either help or hinder the management of innovation and, ultimately, determine whether it succeeds or fails. This course will progress students from understanding the various models and processes of innovation to understanding how to manage that process, particularly how to identify, navigate and manage the people-based complexities of implementing innovation. The course will examine a range of topical and critical aspects relating to the people management components of the innovation process, including: social networks; power and politics; interpersonal skills, influencing, selling and persuading; fostering creativity and innovation at individual, team and organisational levels; diffusing innovation; and the 'dark side' of innovation. Overall, this course will equip students with the 'soft skills' needed by any organisation looking to innovate.Leadership and Ethics
The topics in this course include the following:
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Identify and differentiate the concepts of morals, ethics, values and beliefs

Leadership and ethics have never been so important in contemporary business environments given high profile cases of ethically-compromised corporate failures. This course introduces students to the concepts of ethics and ethical behaviour within the context of leadership for the 21st century. The course will examine contemporary dynamic and complex business environments and explores the need for leaders to manage effectively ethically challenging situations, whilst seeking to balance the (often conflicting) expectations of multiple stakeholders. It examines both the foundations of ethical approaches within the context of leadership and the dominant normative leadership theories as well as emerging values-driven leadership theories. It evaluates such theories and examines closely contemporary issues in leadership and the special role the leader in nurturing ethically-orientated organisations. In addition, students are also introduced to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) – ‘17 Goals to Transform Our World’. In the workshops we discuss the role of leadership in addressing these SDGs.Decision Making under Uncertainty

3. Develop solutions through the creative process of ideation;
4. Apply design thinking principles in practice;
5. Evaluate potential solutions, justifying the methods or processes used to reach them.
Embracing novelty implies comfort with uncertainty and the courage to explore creative paths in situations where detailed roadmaps are not available. This course will equip students with the insight and confidence to create novelty in any organisational context. Creating something “new” implies a comparison to something that already exists. Understanding the context within which new ideas are expected to take hold is an essential starting point for discovering insights into the elements where customer needs are poorly or not at all addressed.. The discovery process (Opportunity identification, Imaging solutions, Explore your opportunity, and Evaluating your solutions) in this course relies on a framework that moves from “what is” (context) to “what if” (possibilities) to “what wows” (concepts) to “what works” (launch). Overall, students will learn how to apply design thinking principles and ultimately turn problems into real-world opportunities.Knowledge Management

5. Demonstrate an advanced ability to create, implement and evaluate entrepreneurial strategies to complex, real-world case studies and a major work-based project
Entrepreneurial Strategy is a 20 credit point capstone course in the Innovation and Entrepreneurship program. The focus is on advancing your knowledge of how to craft and improve key enterprise choices and outcomes. Sustaining enterprises in an environment of accelerated change is also a critical element of this course. This starts here with an identification and framing of a real innovation project and problem. A mix of design thinking and project management will also be incorporated. The course importantly examines the ""why"" and values behind a venture which are known key tenets of great enterprises and their success. What should also be getting clearer is that successful firms are not built around luck but are a result of evidence and crafted strategies to mastermind a better outcome. The capstone applies all your knowledge from the suite of previous courses but with the addition of a major industry based challenge and project that utilises the theory and hones your practical understanding.Social Entrepreneurship

4. Demonstrate experiential learning acquired in developing social enterprise initiatives through the application of knowledge, skills and attributes drawn from the field of social entrepreneurship
Entrepreneurship and venture seeking do not only exist in for-profit businesses but they can equally exist in other sectors. Social entrepreneurship focuses on these other sectors where social enterprise, its formation and development as a pursuit of social objectives is practiced. The course explores the use of innovative methods (including different products, foundations and organisations) to invoke action to practice, yield and sustain societal benefits. The course examines contemporary examples of socially entrepreneurial organisations, their benefits and limitations and their varied organisational structures and designs.Advanced Innovation Management
The topics in this course include the following:
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate understanding of the tools and frameworks of innovation management;

A critical aspect of a modern enterprise is to develop a holistic understanding of innovation management. Enterprise competitive advantage stems from a culture of continuous improvement and strategically driving this from an enhanced interpretation of user needs. This course explores why innovation management plays a pivotal role in such advancement and, in doing so, will include multiple interpretations of innovation management, including a resource based interpretation as well as strategic competitive and open innovation interpretations. Key aspects for students of this broader approach relate to the central role of consistently reviewing business models as well as enterprise functions and processes.Business Development and Growth

3. Analyse the influence of human, structural, technological, cultural, political and symbolic factors in sustainable organisational change
4. Apply an integrated change model to case studies and other real-world organisational settings
5. Work effectively in a group.
Heraclitus (Greek philosopher) said some two thousand years ago that the only constant is change. Leading organisational change examines the theories, frameworks and models of change within the organisational setting and leadership theories, approaches and behaviours that facilitate effective organisational change. The course explores the demise of the rational organisation and the growth of planned and emergent change models within turbulent environments. It examines the critical role of the leader and their decision making in effecting sustainable change and evaluates the multiple human, structural, technological, cultural, political and symbolic factors that affect meaningful change.Strategic Business Management
The topics in this course includes, but is not limited to, the following:
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:

2. Critically analyse and evaluate a firm's strategic vision, mission, and strategy formulation, at a business or corporate level, within the context of the firm's resources, capabilities and structure as well as the external environment, taking into account industry, product, market, customer, competition and rivalry factors;
3. Critically analyse and, in turn, evaluate the likely success of a firm's strategy implementation in the context of organisational structure and controls, governance, strategic leadership, and corporate social and environmental responsibilities;
4. Demonstrate an ability to research, gather and digest, relevant organisational, industry, market and regulatory data, and work as an integral member of a group (in the same fashion as an Executive Management Team) to prepare and deliver analytical results in both written and oral management reporting formats.
Strategic Business Management is the capstone course in the Leadership and Management major.  The course brings together the analytical skills and knowledge acquired in the foundational courses within the major.  Strategic Business Management provides a holistic understanding of contemporary strategic business management in terms of how, between an organisation's resources and capabilities, customers, competition and the dynamics of the global market, firms can achieve a sustainable strategic advantage and above average returns.  The Strategic Business Management course, therefore, places the growth and sustainability of the firm in the context of strategic choice, at both business and corporate levels, which derives from an analysis of the firm's resources and capabilities, the operating environment, customers and competitive rivalry.Innovation and Entrepreneurial Strategy

Often known as the 'science of better', Operations Research (OR) is the cornerstone of effective decision making. OR has enhanced organisations and experiences all around us. From more cost effective scheduling of airline crews to the design of less intrusive cancer radiation therapy treatments, from two-person start-ups to Fortune 500 companies, from global resource planning decisions to optimizing local postal delivery routes, all benefit directly from OR.
This course is intended for students looking to advance their fundamental knowledge of OR techniques as seen in MATH2730. The course delves into both practical and theoretical aspects of established OR techniques and results. The course will better equip students to judge the applicability of methods for given problems, and answer questions as to why two seemingly similar problems differ dramatically with respect to tractability. By the end of the course students will be able to apply known OR techniques effectively and also, develop their own solutions for newer, more challenging problems. Throughout, use will be made of relevant and widely used software packages.Mathematics With a View to Teaching

This course covers the foundational aspects of the vertical themes that run throughout the medical program and inform medical practice; Science & Scholarship; Clinical Practice, Health Societies & Environment; and Professional Development.  
The course presents students with a series of problem-based learning (PBL) scenarios, or working problems, which aim to trigger and develop the student's knowledge and skills in all themes as applicable to clinical practice. PBL scenarios are used to drive student learning and integrate basic science knowledge with medical practice, and to provide clinical context to other learning activities. PBL content is presented using the organising framework of the extended family and their experience of health, illness, health care and medicine. Content is organised by presenting PBL cases where the patient, family and community experience developmental or other changes in one or more body systems. Students investigate the scientific foundations underlying medical conditions and patient responses to these conditions, and explore the principles of prevention and management as they apply to the specific medical conditions.  Students will learn about the principles and core concepts of biomedical science, research and evidence-based medicine, clinical assessment, health promotion and population health.
The course provides an introduction to a range of research and epidemiological concepts which will highlight the importance of research to inform clinical practice, decision-making, and the allocation of resources; and preparing students to be informed consumers of research and evidence. The course also provides an opportunity to explore the socio-cultural-environmental influences on, and determinants of health locally, nationally, and globally, through a lens of public health, health promotion, and patient-focused care. The course also introduces students to opportunities for inter-professional learning and the principles of team work and its importance to safe and effective patient care.
Clinical skills fundamental to clinical practice are taught and assessed throughout via structured clinical teaching workshops using a mix of simulated learning environments and interactions with patients. A broad overview of the body and its functions is presented. Specific content related to cardiorespiratory, alimentary tract, genitourinary and reproductive health is covered. Students apply basic knowledge of pharmacotherapeutics to the management of patients with conditions related to the above. Students are introduced to clinical sciences (anatomy, physiology, cell biology, biochemistry, pathology, immunology, genetics, pharmacology and the clinical behavioural sciences), history taking, physical examination and the rational use of appropriate, readily available diagnostic tests.
This course also introduces students to the legal, ethical and governance frameworks that underpin medical practice in Australia. Content related to registration as a medical student and the associated fitness to practice regime, and requirements for continuing professional development and reflective practice. 
Students will also develop a more in depth understanding of healthcare in Australia and of future career pathways and the need for doctors to remain current in their approaches to health care delivery.Clinical Sciences, Scholarship and Practice 2 Part A

Students will learn content related to the practice area of occupational rehabilitation, a key employer of occupational therapists locally, through lectures, discussion and laboratory activities. Students will conduct a worker/workplace assessment. Another portion of the class is related to practical strategies to assist all persons, with and without disabilities to engage in paid or non-paid work as productive occupation.  Such activities are also reflected in current practice.  Many class sessions and laboratories will be led by clinical specialists.  Students will also demonstrate ability to integrate research evidence into their practice reasoning.
 
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Explain how occupational therapists practice across the field of work rehabilitation and in enabling participation in productive occupation.
2. Analyse the relationship between a worker, work and the environment and that of a person, their productive occupation and their environments.
3. Evaluate a client's capacity to work and return to work.
4. Formulate a viable plan to enable transition within or re-entry into work/productive occupation.
5. Justify the role of occupational therapy for enabling productive occupation within traditional and non-traditional/emerging practice.
6. Communicate and collaborate effectively, in both oral and written form, independently and within a group, using the appropriate conventions of the discipline.
Productivity is one of the three major components of occupational therapy practice in the PEO Model namely: self-care, productivity & leisure. This course will focus on adults and older adults (18+ years). Disability Management in its broadest sense will be examined from an Australian and international perspective. This will encompass the employee who has sustained a workplace injury, and persons with a disability (congenital or acquired) that is not work related but impacts upon their ability to do typical workloads. The course will also encompass those with chronic conditions living in the community who wish to continue productive living in some form or another.
Productive living will therefore encompass all forms of productive work (e.g. specialised workshops, men sheds, technical groups, clubs such as Rotary or Lions Clubs, volunteering, making things for sale, growing vegetables for the neighbourhood, etc.). Productivity is therefore defined as work related but not just paid work. Being productive is part of healthy living.Children, Youth and Families: An Occupational Approach

As philosophers such as Charles Taylor have observed, in the contemporary world it is no longer the case that belief in 'God' is the default setting, and no longer do the majority opt to embrace one of the more 'traditional' religious forms of life. In fact, the present climate is characterised by the availability of a variety of religious and non-religious options, movements, or ways of life. In this context, what does it mean to speak of 'God' when 'god' is a word that is used to describe all manner of things? This course will examine the development of the philosophical arguments addressed to these questions in the modern period. Students will learn to evaluate the key writers on the subject, and will be expected to identify the evolution of philosophical factors which have contributed to major changes in religious thought."

Attention is also given to the emergence of new policy frameworks, especially economic rationalism, and their impact on these processes.Democracy in the 21st Century: Local Power, Policy and Participatory Politics
The topics in this course include the following:
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Identify, describe, interpret, analyse and apply key political theories of local power, politics and policy.
2. Identify, describe, interpret, analyse and apply different conceptualisations of participatory democracy and citizenship.
3. Evaluate experiences of participatory democracy and local politics in comparative perspective
4. Demonstrate skills of critical policy analysis.
5. Conceptualise and analyse political decision-making and motivations to participate.
Democracy in the 21st Century  explores and evaluates solutions to the growing Global disenchantment with Liberal representative democracy. Institutions and organisations as distinct as the World Bank, Left of Centre Governments in Latin America, non-governmental organisations, the Occupy movement in the States, and social movements in the Middle East are all responding to this political situation by valuing political organising, authority, decision-making, and policy-making which are based at the scale of the local, are organised through the local community and are justified through the language of participation. 
The course provides both, a 'bottom up' and 'top down' view by exploring the debates and practices surrounding this focus on the local and the role of participation in the re-enchantment of democracy in the 21st Century. It will begin with a focus on key debates in political theory which are shaping political practice and then use these to evaluate a series of case studies from across the Globe, including good governance, participatory budgeting, participatory poverty reduction, insurgent citizenship, and the politics of autonomy.Politics Honours 1

Reading, including critically evaluating one’s own work and that of others.		Writing, including understanding academic writing conventions and the assumptions that underpin disciplinarily diverse language, understanding the logic and process of peer review, synthesising the ideas of others, and developing one’s own voice and style as appropriate for scholarly contexts.		Oral communication, including developing awareness of different audiences and their expectations, and communication through presentations with both diverse scholarly and lay audiences.
 
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. demonstrate understanding of disciplinary diversity in common academic conventions.
2. demonstrate advanced academic practices in written communication including the use of genres appropriate to the disciplinary context, and critiquing and synthesising  the ideas of other authors in written argument.

The course begins with an introduction to the ‘ABC’ of critical thinking. It then moves to a critical evaluation of mainstream understandings of critical thinking through exploration of a diverse range of theories, including feminism, post-structuralism, decolonial theory and critical indigenous theory. It organises this critical evaluation through an exploration of how the theories differently understand a range of concepts that are key to critical thinking such as textuality and text, literacy and translation, theory and theorising, author and audience, polemic and dialogue, and reflexivity and listening.
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Demonstrate capacity to compare, contrast and evaluate a diverse range of theoretical understandings and practises of critical thinking.

How can I use my psychological skills and competencies after graduation? What does it mean to be a psychologist? How do psychologists deal with the ethical issues they face in their work? This course explores these questions and will provide students with an understanding of psychological practice, the skills and competencies required to undertake it, and how an accredited psychology program provides this training. Students will hear first-hand accounts from psychology graduates from a wide range of psychology and psychology-related fields. Problem-based lab classes and self-directed learning will allow students to further explore their understanding of what psychological practice entails including a focus on foundational skills and ethical decision making.Sex, Drugs and Serial Killers
1. Sex and sexuality invites the question of how do we understand gender in our modern world? You may think you know how gender is created and how it determines who someone is, but ongoing research shows us that sex, gender and sexuality are not just male/female, masculine/feminine, straight/gay categories but complex continuums of diversity that are partly due to brain and body chemistry and also due to the structure of our society.
2. Drug and drug addiction (and in fact other types of addiction) explores the relationship between chemical and social interactions, and their impact on our susceptibility to addiction. We examine how common drugs work to become addictive and we look at some case studies of successful (and unsuccessful) rehabilitation.
3. Criminal psychology examines the darker side of psychology by investigating those that display extreme behaviours that both horrify and fascinate us: serial killers. To fully understand people driven to compulsive homicide, we look at the dark side of all of us as you form part of a jury in a murder trial. How common are the dark personalities of narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy. Do we all have a touch of these within us?
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Recognise and identify core concepts related to sex and gender; drug use and addiction; and psychopathy and obsessive criminal homicide.
2. Identify key indicators of addiction and barriers to rehabilitation using a case example.
3. Communicate the distinctions between criminal behaviour and obsessive homicide.
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of psychological interventions related to core topics in the course.
Psychology is a fascinating and challenging area of science, devoted to understanding the most complex animals on the planet – us! Through a modularised approach, PSYC1800 will explore three intriguing areas of everyday psychology: sex and sexuality, drug and drug addiction, and criminal psychology
Students will use personal reflection and case studies, and even form part of a mock jury to explore questions and concepts such as: What is sex and sexuality? How does drug use become addictive? Is there such as thing as a criminal mindset?Foundations of Psychological Interventions

5. Identify the relevant information from an intake interview needed to produce a case report.
6. Formulate a preliminary diagnosis and intervention strategy from a case study.
'Intervention' to change human behaviour underpins much of the professional application of psychology. However, the specific approaches and techniques that psychologists use to support their clients have been evolving for over a century. 
This course will provide a brief history of modern psychotherapy, from Freudian psychoanalysis, to Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, and more recent advances including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Motivational Interviewing. The course also covers the important role of case reports for informing clinical practice, and how therapy can be tailored for different delivery modes (e.g., individual vs family) and subgroups (e.g., young people vs older adults).
Each week, students will learn the key background and theory behind a particular therapy style through short, pre-recorded ‘mini-lectures’. Then, practicing psychologists will bring these concepts to life in live lectures focusing on case studies and applied examples from their work. In the labs, the students will apply their new knowledge in hands-on activities, including opportunities to practice different counselling skills with their peers.Cognitive Psychology

5. Compile a consultation paper for a professional organisation to address a problem regarding human behaviour in that non-clinical professional context.
The field of applied psychology implements psychological knowledge to analyse and maximise the performance of individuals and organisations across the range of non-clinical professional environments where psychology graduates often work. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to apply psychological knowledge to inform the development of evidence-based programs that aim to optimise individual and organisational outcomes in non-clinical professional contexts (e.g., education, human resources, aged care, rehabilitation, management).
Each student will prepare a consultation paper on a topic relevant to a non-clinical professional context where psychology graduates are often employed. The course involves integrated content across interactive lectures, skill-based workshops, online consultation sessions and forums on Discussion Board. These are designed to maximise student engagement through live and online discussion and Q&A so as to directly inform all assessments and scaffold the self-directed learning skills needed to complete the consultation paper.
Teaching content and assessments are designed to support students to integrate information from multiple academic and professional resources and use these to complete a consultation paper, ie., an industry paper that analyses a problem and provides evidence-based recommendations for the professional organisation.

Cognitive Psychology is the scientific study of human behaviour and mental processes from an information-processing perspective. It is a growing field that has many exciting applications to our day-to-day life. Cognitive Psychology asks how people receive information from the environment (perception), store it (memory), and use it to make decisions, solve problems, and communicate. The course covers contemporary theories and models in selected topics of cognitive psychology. It then identifies real-life problems in these areas, and presents applied approaches for testing and solving these problems. In the application phase students will gain hands-on skills in experimental design, data-collection, and data-analysis, all aimed at addressing real-life problems. The course is made of four successive modules: 
-	Information processing, cognitive workload and capacity (theory and applications)
-	Special topics in the application of cognition across the life span
-	Applied decision making (e.g., consumer choices, choices among multiple health programs)
-	Applying mathematical and computational models to cognitive scienceAdvanced Perception and Learning in Psychology
Historical background of theories of learning and perceptionContemporary theories of perception and learning and how these theories may be used in applied and clinical situationsHow information that is extracted by different brain regions results in our unified perceptual experienceExamining perceptual neuropsychology case studies, revealing the function of our perceptual systemsHuman language perception and production systemsHow language dysfunctions and disorders facilitate our understanding of human languageTheories and experimental phenomena of Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, and their modern, real-world applications. 	 
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Integrate evidence from perception research and neuropsychological case studies to evaluate theories of perception.
2. Integrate evidence from language research and language disorders to understand human language.
3. Explain the empirical and theoretical issues in the contemporary study of associative learning.
4. Explain the importance of associative learning for the aetiology of clinical/treatment procedures.
5. Integrate and explain how the principles of learning and perception are investigated and applied by generating and testing hypotheses.
Psychologists have long abandoned the idea that our perceptions are simply an internal picture of the world, but there is no consensus on exactly how we maintain perceptual contact with the world. This course examines evidence for and against various theories of perception, addressing the question of how perception is organised. It links research on perceptual phenomena, research on pathways in the brain, and neuropsychology case studies, allowing students to see the importance of a relevant understanding of perceptual processes for both the psychology discipline and professional practice. Reading and language disorders are examined from both a clinical and a research perspective. The course also considers the other historically dominant field in psychology: learning. From Thorndike’s, Skinner’s and Pavlov's early work through to cognitive explanations of learning, we again focus on the experiments and theories that underpin our understanding of how humans learn. The course’s coverage of associative learning provides a core foundation for further study in applications of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

Our understanding of human behaviour comes from our ability as psychological researchers to apply appropriate research methods and statistics to answer research questions. PSYC6830 examines advanced univariate research designs and related inferential statistics. PSYC6830 extends coverage of design and analysis principles and skills introduced in undergraduate research methods and statistics courses with students applying their knowledge to designing research projects. Students receive comprehensive training in the use of a statistical package in order to analyse, interpret and present research findings. Students will critically evaluate research design and develop and undertake a research project implementing sound research methodology and ethical principles. Students will cover psychological research methodologies such as factorial experiments as well as repeated measures and correlational designs. Students will expand on their foundational analysis skills to include between subject, repeated measures and mixed ANOVA with more than one factor and multiple linear regression and apply these to their research designs.
At this level, students are introduced to real experimental and correlational designs that produce data that are less than ideal. Students will explore general models of statistical analysis in order to equip them with the skills to deal with the problems that might be encountered in their own research work. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to apply the principles they are learning to the development of their own research project, and consider specific problems related to methodology and ethics. Lab sessions will provide support in the use of a statistical software package to manipulate and perform statistical analyses on both simulated data as well as their own research data. Lab sessions will also provide training in conducting real research and understanding, interpreting and reporting the results.

5. Apply core principles of learning experimentation and theory to example research designs in experimental and applied learning.
Psychologists have long abandoned the idea that our perceptions are simply an internal picture of the world, but there is no consensus on exactly how we maintain perceptual contact with the world. This course examines evidence for and against various theories of perception, addressing the question of how perception is organised. It links research on perceptual phenomena, research on pathways in the brain, and neuropsychology case studies, allowing students to see the importance of a relevant understanding of perceptual processes for both the psychology discipline and professional practice. Reading and language disorders are examined from both a clinical and a research perspective. The course also considers the other historically dominant field in psychology: learning. From Thorndike’s, Skinner’s and Pavlov's early work through to cognitive explanations of learning, we again focus on the experiments and theories that underpin our understanding of how humans learn. The course’s coverage of associative learning provides a core foundation for further study in applications of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT).

This online course focuses on high level ethical decision making relating to individual, group and community practice. It runs parallel to SWRK3300:Field Practicum. Students will be required to integrate and critique theoretical models and decision making tools relevant to their practicum field of practice.Field Practicum 1
Each student is placed in a human service organisation for a minimum of 70 days/ (500 hours) to complete social work tasks with the support of supervision from a qualified social worker (field educator or external field educator).
The student prepares a learning plan based on the AASW practice standards in consultation with the field educator and/or external field educator that specifies tasks and outcomes to be achieved during the practicum. The learning plan template and preparation guide is available on Blackboard for SWRK3300. The learning plan identifies how the student will demonstrate achievement of the learning objectives, against which the student is assessed. The learning plan should be submitted electronically to the student's University Field Liaison Officer within ten days of commencing placement. The Field Liaison Officer will provide feedback to the student on their plan and advise of its feasibility and acceptance.
A mid-placement review is conducted to facilitate processing of what has happened to date on the placement, contribute to planning of the remainder of placement and renegotiate the learning plan, if necessary. The mid-placement review involves a visit to the agency by the university liaison officer and a three-way discussion on the learning process with the student, field educator and external field educator where one is appointed. Decisions and outcomes from this discussion should be incorporated into a mid-placement report prepared by the student. The mid- placement report template is available on Blackboard for SWRK3300. The mid-placement report should be submitted electronically to the university liaison within five days of the mid-placement visit. Your university liaison will complete feedback and make recommendations on the basis of this report.
An end of placement review by student, field educator and external field educator where there is one appointed provides the opportunity to reflect on the second part of placement and to look for future learning needs. The end of placement report is submitted by the Field Educator but is completed in consultation with the student. Students do not need to submit an additional report. NB. All reports must be received by the School (with a signed hard copy) before a final grade will be awarded. The end of placement field educator's report seeks feedback from the field educator/s on the student's progress towards learning goals, an assessment of the student's strengths and areas for development, and a review of opportunities the field educator has had to observe student performance. A standardised report format is included on Blackboard for SWRK3300. All field educators also receive an electronic copy of these documents. The completed and signed report should be sent to the PEU in hard copy. Mailing details are included in the Field Education Handbook (a copy of which is on the Blackboard site for SWRK3300).
 
Classes prior to and during the placement will address practicum learning processes needed to progress through the course and are a compulsory requirement of SWRK3300.

Landscape, Ethnography, PowerUrban LandscapesEnergy LandscapesPandemic Landscapes
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Practice the ethnographic study of landscape using field visits, images, and written texts;
2. Outline the ways that diverse landscapes work together to produce the regions where we live and study;
3. Design independent research inquiry into landscapes;
4. Collaborate with diverse (and remote) groups in developing a comparative research agenda for the study of landscapes in distinct regions;
5. Identify the politics of place-making in two geographically distant regions with shared pasts of indigenous dispossession, resource extraction, and post-industrial reconfiguration.
This course examines ways to think about the relationships between society, space and power through analysing landscapes in our local region and in different parts of the world. The course will include some shared content and virtual exchange with students undertaking a similar course at the University of Texas, Austin. Both Austin and Newcastle have shared pasts of indigenous dispossession, resource extraction, and post-industrial reconfiguration. At different points in the course, students will conduct a field visit, produce an ethnographic piece of writing exploring that landscape, and compare with colleagues working in similar spaces but on different continents. This course will provide students with an introduction to ethnographic writing and practice, and introduce them to ways to understand and think (differently) about the landscapes and environments around them. Students will share their research projects between cohorts in both universities, an innovation that will encourage comparison of both regions and the identification of shared and divergent elements.Alcohol and other Drugs in Sociological Perspective

5. Examine post-capitalist alternative practices, systems, movements, models and agendas.
Capitalist and liberal democratic systems, while being at their global climax in both the developed and developing worlds, are facing serious challenges: from the rising socio-economic inequalities, to the disturbing uncertainties in food, fuel and finance, to the looming threats of nuclear conflicts, trade wars/rivalries, political extremism, terrorism, global pandemics, and above all, climate change. Will global capitalism and Euro-centric modernity survive these crises? Will we be able to transition smoothly into more sustainable and resilient socio-ecological systems? Can new technological advances save civilization? Or do we need far more radical transformations and urgent responses at both the macro and micro levels? Is the end of 'organized life' now more imaginable than the end of capitalism? Is Life beyond Capital, Carbon, Constant growth and Consumerism possible or is this just a utopian dream? What are the plausible post-capitalist futures and how can they be realized? 
This course attempts to answer these questions by investigating how the past and present major trends of change influence our future and how grassroots initiatives and movements strive to create future societies beyond dependence on capital, carbon, consumerism, growth and discrimination. More specifically, it provides us with key insights into the nature and future of capitalist globalisation for social justice, sustainability and development.Sociology and Psychology of Mental Health for Occupational Therapy

In the rural areas of developing countries, food security is frequently a problem despite proximity to agricultural land. This course investigates this problem and considers useful solutions for community development in the social contexts of  different parts of the developing world. Governments can operate to relieve food security by enacting policies at a national level, with impacts on urban and rural food security. What are the options and the advantages and disadvantages? Sustainable solutions through interventions in agriculture are also proposed and can be enacted at a local level by government agencies or initiated by local or international NGOs. What kinds of nutritional deficit are typical and what are the agricultural strategies that can address these in the context of rural poverty? How can we design an agricultural strategy for a particular situation? How does the local context of land ownership and culture impact on what can work in community development? A commonly proposed solution is to move farmers away from dependence on subsistence and into a greater involvement in the market. What are the pitfalls of this strategy and how can we decide when the local context makes it appropriate?"

Final Assignment
On successful completion of the course students will be able to:
1. Recognise limb threatening injuries
2. Describe typical injury mechanisms of upper and lower limb fractures
3. Discuss optimal timing, complications and priorities
The Musculoskeletal Trauma Course will discuss both low-energy and high-energy injuries of the extremities. This course will cover all diaphyseal, metaphyseal and articular fracture management of both the upper and lower limb.Neurotrauma
The Course is comprised of online lectures delivered by a variety of eminent physicians in the field.
The Course will be organised for one semester of 12 weeks with 1 major topic every 3 weeks as follows:
Week 1-3: Introduction to neurotrauma
