This course introduces the basic skills required to investigate the expressive potential of digital photography. Using tone, colour and light as exploratory tools, students will be introduced to a broad range of photographic techniques. This foundation experience also considers the basic technical, historical and conceptual dimensions of photography. Students will develop an understanding of how the technology of the camera mediates our perception of reality and conditions photographic communication.",,https://www.newcastle.edu.au/,https://www.newcastle.edu.au/course/AART1700,
